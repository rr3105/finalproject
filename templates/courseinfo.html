     <p>My favorite course at Columbia:</p>
     
     <p style="margin-left:3%">
     
     Of all the classes I've taken in the last four years at Columbia, it's hard
     for me to come up with one absolute favorite. Instead, I have a few. First,
     I really liked University Writing as a freshman. I feel that the class 
     honed my writing skills and made me aware of political/social issues
     in a way I hadn't been before. Next, I really enjoyed taking Intro to Java
     with Adam Cannon. The class exposed me to object-oriented programming and 
     thinking big picture before delving into smaller details to solve each problem, 
     and I also enjoyed the CS theory-related parts of that class. Finally, 
     Econometrics with Jushan Bai was a great class for me. Though difficult,
     I learned a lot about how to make connections between phenomena in the real 
     world and quantifying the above with data and models. All in all, Columbia
     has provided me with a solid foundational education, and I look forward to 
     the next phase in my intellectual life and career.
